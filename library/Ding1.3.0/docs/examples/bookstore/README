NOTE: This is a work in progress. The idea is to show you how to create a 
complete ding application (in this case, a web application, but all you'll see
can also be applied to a console application). 

Currently, the mvc has some limitations, but the core point is to show how to
use the container to use DI and AOP quite easily.

This bookstore will use doctrine as its orm, so you should install doctrine2
if you want to run it.


# Create the database:
$ cd docs/examples/bookstore
$ doctrine orm:schema:create

Now setup your apache or lighttpd with a virtual host for docs/examples/bookstore.
You will need a rewrite rule that maps everything not a file to index.php. This
is an example for lighttpd:

  url.rewrite-if-not-file = (
    ".*\?(.*)$" => "/index.php?$1",
    "" => "/index.php"
  )

For apache, you can use something like this:
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php/$1
